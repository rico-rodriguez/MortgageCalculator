            #   Task:   Calculate loan payment for fixed rate loans:
            
            #   Total loan value [P]:
                                # Home purchase price
                                # Amount of down payment
                                # Origination fee of 1% added to initial loan amount
                                # Fixed fee of $2500 added to total
                                
            #   Annual interest rate [r]:

            #   Number of years [n]:
                                # 30 years for fixed rate loans
                                # 15 years for fixed rate loans

            #   Number of payments [n]:
                                # 30 years = 360 payments
                                # 15 years = 180 payments

            #   Monthly payment [M]:
                                # M = P * (r/12) / (1 - (1 + r/12)^-n)
                                # M = monthly payment
                                # P = total loan value
                                # r = annual interest rate
                                # n = number of payments
                                # 12 = number of months in a year
                                # ^-n = exponent of -n

            #   Variables:
                                # var [loanDuration]: 15 or 30
                                # var Purchase price
                                # var Down Payment
                                # Origination fee (1% to loan amount)
                                # Fixed fee ($2500)

            #   Loan insurance:
                                # Required for any loan which:
                                    # Equity at inception < 10% market value
                                    # (10% + deficit in home value) VS. [Loan value]
                                # If required, cost is 1% of initial loan value divided by [loanDuration]

            #   HOA Fees:
                                # [Monthly total] = [Yearly fee] / [Payment Period]
                                # [Monthly total] += [Base Payment]
             
             #  Escrow
                                # Both based off current market value at time of loan inception:
                                    # Property tax = 1.25% yearly / 12
                                    # Home owner insurance = 0.75% yearly / 12
                                # Compute payment per term (monthly) and + to total monthly payment
                                
             #  Approval
                                # Determine if [Monthly payment] is >= 25% of buyers monthly income
                                    # If over, deny, else, approve
                                        #If denied, display "Placing more money down and Look at buying a more affordable home."

            #   Monthly payment
                                # Base loan amount (principal and interest)
                                # Escrow amount
                                    # Homeowner insurance + Property tax (1.25% of total home value by year/12)
